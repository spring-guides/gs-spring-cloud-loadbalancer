This guide walks you through the process of creating load-balanced microservices.

== What You Will Build

You will build a microservice application that uses Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to provide
client-side load-balancing in calls to another microservice.

== Create a Root Project

This guide walks through building two projects, one of which is a dependency to the other.
Consequently, you need to create two child projects under a root project. First, create
the build configuration at the top level. For Maven, you need a `pom.xml` with `<modules>`
that list the subdirectories:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----
====

For Gradle, you need want a `settings.gradle` that includes the same directories:

====
[src,groovy]
----
include::complete/settings.gradle[]
----
====

Optionally, you can include an empty `build.gradle` (to help IDEs identify the root directory).


=== Create the Directory Structure

In the directory that you want to be your root directory, create the following
subdirectory structure (for example, with `mkdir say-hello user` on *nix systems):

    └── say-hello
    └── user

In the root of the project, you need to set up a build system, and this guide shows
you how to use Maven or Gradle.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

If you use Maven for the `Say Hello` project, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&name=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&dependencies=web[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependency (Spring Web).

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::initial/say-hello/pom.xml[]
----
====

If you use Gradle for the `Say Hello` project, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&name=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-loadbalancer-say-hello&dependencies=web[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependency (Spring Web).

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file that is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[source,text]
----
include::initial/say-hello/build.gradle[]
----
====

If you use Maven for the `User` project, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&name=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&dependencies=cloud-loadbalancer,webflux[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependencies (Cloud Loadbalancer and Spring Reactive Web).

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::initial/user/pom.xml[]
----
====

If you use Gradle for the `User` project, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&name=spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-cloud-loadbalancer-user&dependencies=cloud-loadbalancer,webflux[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependencies (Cloud Loadbalancer and Spring Reactive Web).

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file that is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[source,text]
----
include::initial/user/build.gradle[]
----
====

=== Manual Initialization (optional)

If you want to initialize the project manually rather than use the links shown earlier, follow the steps given below:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web* (for the `Say Hello` project) or *Cloud Loadbalancer* and *Spring Reactive Web* (for the `User` project).
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

== Implement the "Say Hello" service

Our "`server`" service is called `Say Hello`.
It returns a random greeting (picked out of a static list of three) from an endpoint that is accessible at `/greeting`.

In `src/main/java/hello`, create the file `SayHelloApplication.java`.

The following listing shows the contents of `say-hello/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloApplication.java`:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/say-hello/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloApplication.java[]
----
====

It is a simple `@RestController`, where we have one `@RequestMapping method` for the `/greeting` and another for the root path `/`.

We are going to run multiple instances of this application locally alongside a client service application.
To get started:

. Create a `src/main/resources` directory.
. Create a `application.yml` file within the directory.
. In that file, set a default value for `server.port`.

(We will instruct the other instances of the application to run on other ports so that none of the `Say Hello` instances conflict with the client when we get that running).
While we are in this file, we can set the `spring.application.name` for our service too.

The following listing shows the contents of `say-hello/src/main/resources/application.yml`:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/say-hello/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----
====

== Access from a Client Service

Our users see the `User` application.
It makes a call to the `Say Hello` application to get a greeting and then sends that greeting to our user when the user visits the endpoints at `/hi` and `/hello`.

In the User application directory, under `src/main/java/hello`, add the `UserApplication.java` file:

The following listing shows the contents of `user/src/main/java/hello/UserApplication.java`

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/UserApplication.java[]
----
====
We also need a `@Configuration` class where we set up a load-balanced `WebClient.Builder` instance:

The following listing shows the contents of `user/src/main/java/hello/WebClientConfig.java`:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/WebClientConfig.java[]
----
====

The configuration provides a `@LoadBalanced WebClient.Builder` instance, which we use when someone hits the `hi` endpoint of
`UserApplication.java`.
Once the `hi` endpoint is hit, we use this builder to create a `WebClient` instance, which makes an HTTP `GET` request to the `Say Hello` service's URL and gives us the result as a `String`.

In `UserApplication.java`, we have also added a `/hello` endpoint that does the same action. However, rather than use the `@LoadBalanced` annotation, we use an `@Autowired` load-balancer exchange filter function (`lbFunction`), which we pass by using the `filter()` method to a `WebClient` instance that we programmatically build.

TIP: Even though we set up the load-balanced `WebClient` instance slightly differently for the two endpoints, the end behavior for both is exactly the same.
Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is used to select an appropriate instance of the `Say Hello` service.

Add the `spring.application.name` and `server.port` properties to `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

The following listing shows the contents of `user/src/main/resources/application.yml`

====
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----
====

== Loadbalance Across Server Instances

Now we can access `/hi` or `hello` on the User service and see a friendly greeting:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8888/hi
Greetings, Mary!

$ curl http://localhost:8888/hi?name=Orontes
Salutations, Orontes!
----
====

In `WebClientConfig.java`, we pass a custom configuration for the LoadBalancer by using the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation:

====
[source,java]
----
@LoadBalancerClient(name = "say-hello", configuration = SayHelloConfiguration.class)
----
====

This means that, whenever a service named `say-hello` is contacted, instead of running with the default setup, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer uses the configuration provided in `SayHelloConfiguration.java`.

The following listing shows the contents of `user/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloConfiguration.java`:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloConfiguration.java[]
----
====

In that class, we provide a custom `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` with three hard-coded instances that Spring Cloud LoadBalancer chooses from while making the calls to the `Say Hello` service.

NOTE: This step has been added to explain how you can pass your own custom configuration to the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
However, you need not use the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation and create your own configuration for the LoadBalancer.
The most typical way is to use Spring Cloud LoadBalancer with service discovery.
If you have any `DiscoveryClient` on your classpath, the default Spring Cloud LoadBalancer configuration uses it to check for service instances. As a result, you only choose from instances that are up and running.
You can learn how to use `ServiceDiscovery` with this https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/[guide].

We also add an `application.yml` file with default `server.port` and `spring.application.name`.

The following listing shows the contents of `user/src/main/resources/application.yml`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----
====

== Testing the Loadbalancer

The following listing shows how to run the `Say Hello` service with Gradle:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----
====

The following listing shows how to run the `Say Hello` service with Maven:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
====

To achieve load balancing, you need two servers running separate instances of the same application.
You can achieve that by running a second instance of the `Say Hello` service on a different port.
We use port 9999 for this example.

To do so with Gradle, open a new terminal and run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
export SERVER_PORT=9092 
./gradlew bootRun
----
====

To do so with Maven, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
export SERVER_PORT=9999 
mvn spring-boot:run
----
====

Then you can start the `User` service. At this point, you should have three terminals: two for two instances of `Say Hello` and one for `User`.
Then you can access `localhost:8888/hi` and watch the `Say Hello` service instances.

Your requests to the `User` service should result in calls to `Say Hello` being spread across the running instances in round-robin fashion:

====
----
2016-03-09 21:15:28.915  INFO 90046 --- [nio-8090-exec-7] hello.SayHelloApplication                : Access /greeting
----
====

== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a Spring Loadbalancer application!
